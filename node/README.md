NOTE:

The application is deployed at http://de-mucdevondepl01:8091
To read the emails sended by the application you can go to http://de-mucdevondepl01:8092

IMPORTANT: The application is working but there is something peding:

- Test: all test are missing
- JSDoc: all classes/methods do not have a proper JSDoc.
- Better exception handling: layer service shouldn't know anything about the HTTP response to the client. Thats why we throw a normal Error in the service layer and then we catch them at controller layer and send to the client the proper HTTP error. This mechanism is OK, but we can improve it by creating errors and then adding an error handling which is the responsible to send the correct HTTP error to the client. This feature will arrive soon.
